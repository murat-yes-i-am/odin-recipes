  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <p>

  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Flour</b>: This homemade pancake recipe starts with all-purpose flour.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Baking powder</b>: Baking powder, a leavener, is the secret to fluffy pancakes.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Sugar</b>: Just a tablespoon of white sugar is all you'll need for subtly sweet pancakes.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Salt</b>: A pinch of salt will enhance the overall flavor without making your pancakes taste salty.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Milk and butter</b>: Milk and butter add moisture and richness to the pancakes.
    </li>
